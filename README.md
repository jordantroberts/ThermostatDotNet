Rebuilding my Makers Academy <a href="https://github.com/jordantroberts/thermostat-js">Thermostat</a> project as a single page application using .NET Core, with C# for the backend and React for the frontend.

## How to run this program

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project.
4. Visit `localhost:5001`

Alternatively, this program has been published to Azure <a href="https://thermostattestproject.azurewebsites.net/">here</a> :)

## How to test this program

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 above.
2. If using Visual Studio Community, select 'Run Unit Tests' under 'Run'. This may be different if using a PC.

The minimum temperature has been set at 10 degrees, the maximum at 30 degrees and the default at 20 degrees (which you can change in the code if you like). You can increase and decrease the thermostat temperature within this range. The 'reset' button will reset the temperature back to 20 degrees.
